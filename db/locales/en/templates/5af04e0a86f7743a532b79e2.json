	"Name": "Single-axis Fiber Optic Gyroscope",
	"ShortName": "Gyroscope",
	"Description": "Single and dual-axis Fiber Optic Gyroscopes (FOG) have been developed for high-performance military applications and are of the highest quality. The FOGs provide compensated yaw rates to the synchronous Integrated Bus for Intelligent Sensors (IBIS) or the asynchronous RS-422 interface.\n\nDeveloped for use in particularly harsh environments, the gyroscopes can withstand extreme shock and vibration in accordance with MIL-STD-810 ground mobile use, are fully digitized, include on-line BIT, and have no moving parts."
