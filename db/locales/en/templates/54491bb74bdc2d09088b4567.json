	"Description": "Extrema Ratio developed its Fulcrum knife by the order of Italian Alpine Troops Headquarters, who required a multipurpose knife suitable for the infantry, a knife that could be used in any action and that could successfully solve any type of problem even where more specialized equipment proved inadequate. It was so successful that the multipurpose knife then led to the development of the Fulcrum Bayonet, which had the same characteristics but could be fixed to the issued rifle."
