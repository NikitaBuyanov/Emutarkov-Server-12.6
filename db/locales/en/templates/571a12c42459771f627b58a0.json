	"Name": "TT pistol 7.62x25 TT",
	"ShortName": "TT",
	"Description": "A legendary pistol. It has seen numerous military conflicts and is still being in service in certain spots of our planet, in one modification or another. This one is a classic TT-33, the most mass-produced version. It features Browning short-recoil tilting-barrel system, but very different otherwise - purposefully simple, single-action, no safety measures except half-cock notch, it is able to withstand horrible operating abuse. Thanks to the powerful 7.62x25 cartridge and relatively long barrel, TT boasts high muzzle velocity, penetration, and impressive accuracy, even over long distances."
