	"Name": "TT pistol 7.62x25 TT Gold",
	"ShortName": "TT",
	"Description": "A legendary pistol. It has seen numerous military conflicts and is still being in service in the certain spots of our planet, in one modification or another. This one is a classic TT-33, the most mass-produced version. It features Browning short-recoil tilting-barrel system, but very different otherwise - purposefully simple, single-action, no safety measures except half cock notch, it is able to withstand horrible operating abuse. Thanks to powerful 7.62x25 cartridge and relatively long barrel, TT boasts high muzzle velocity, penetration and impressive accuracy, even over long distances. Special gold edition."
