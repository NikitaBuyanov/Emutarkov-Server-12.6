	"Name": "Scav Backpack",
	"ShortName": "ScavBP",
	"Description": "Cheap replica of some 3-day assault pack with MOLLE attachment system, adapted and enhanced by owner as much as his creativity allowed. Does not offer much comfort, and volume is far lower than that of a proper 3-day pack, but it's still a backpack alright."
