	"Name": "PM (t) 9x18PM pistol",
	"ShortName": "PM(t)",
	"Description": "A semi-mythical PM with extended barrel and suppressor mount threading. Some claim it was a limited series manufactured in Bulgaria, others insist on DDR, and some are even prone to think of it as a handcrafted upgrade. How did it end up in the Norvinsk region, no living soul can tell."
