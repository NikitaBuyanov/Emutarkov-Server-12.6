"You have not failed with the shotgun, so you may know your way around tools. That didn’t save me much time though. All exchanges are on fire, hope it won’t start the panic. Nevertheless, the plan remains the same, I think it's not for long. Okay, I need to work. And you, try to get hold of AKSU. With B-11 handguard, 60-round extended mag, and compact, 6 cells max. Ergonomics over 60, recoil sum less than 600, sighting range 100 or more. And, of course, as light as possible, 3.5 kg or less. Yes, indexes here have nothing to do with that. I hope you've remembered everything. See you soon."
