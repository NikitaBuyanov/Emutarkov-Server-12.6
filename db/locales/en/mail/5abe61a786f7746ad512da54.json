"Hello, young man. Truly glad to see you. I have a very important assignment, not for everybody to take on. Will you take it? Then listen. Do you know the sawmill in the Woods? So, during the Contract Wars period, it was used as one of the makeshift backup supply bases for TerraGroup. And I am very interested in TerraGroup supply plans in this region. I think they should be somewhere on the territory as well. Try to search for the temporary quarters for workers - this should be a secure case for documents with a special symbol."
