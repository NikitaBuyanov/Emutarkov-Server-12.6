"Just imagine how many folks used to hang around at Ultra, mommies with kids, couples, and so on, everybody stocked tight, too. Damn, felt sooo cool, maybe you remember, a lot of movement went down. But I digress into nostalgia, no time for that, letâ€™s get shit done, yo. Do the world a favor, clean the Ultra up from Scavs, so I could send my boys in. I warned them what is gonna happen if they don't leave."
