"Ah, it's you... Long time no see. I thought maybe you got wasted, but, as it turns out, you’re a bit of a diehard. Whatever, alive, that’s okay, so listen here.\n \nPeople say there’s a new product on the market, some stuff in fancy chemical containers, like your gun silencer, but a bit larger.\n \nWhat’s inside them, whether it’s new drugs or vitamin B, no fucking idea whatsoever. And that’s what we need to find out, my bet is that blue-barrel shit from Polikhim somehow connected to this, but I don’t know it for a fact. These containers were seen at the resort, and one pal of mine claims to have seen them on EMERCOM people at the Interchange, but he was in delirium at that time, maybe just his imagination. To cut the long story short, procure me a couple of those containers, I have a couple of eggheads who might figure out what the fuck is inside."
