"Well hello there! I’ve been watching you for a long time - I’ve heard about your good and bad deeds. In our difficult time, it is hard to remain the same person - you have to choose the side. So here I am on the side of those who clean our land from various infections, the ones that drag us further into the dark abyss. If you would like to join, I will be glad of any help. The mechanic let me know about your track record, says one can rely on you. Given the circumstances I have no more will power to stay away from what is happening in the district. At first, I thought that it would be best to sit out in the wilderness in my reserve. But after what the local bandits started doing, after all these murders and robberies, after what they did to our city ... In general, I definitely need your services. And first of all, I need you to get supplies. The hermit's lifestyle routinely depleted my provisions."
