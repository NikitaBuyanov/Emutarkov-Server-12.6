"Come on in, no need to stand in the doorway. I have a business for you. I'm all busy with orders, and I'm almost out of materials. Can you find some? I will be able to offer you something new for it. It won't be cheap though. Made in.. well, you know where. And yeah, make sure that those materials should be in good shape. I'm pretty sure they used to have such materials in Ultra back in the day. Good luck"
