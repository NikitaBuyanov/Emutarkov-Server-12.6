"Before the conflict, I frequently ordered stuff online. Used to come regularly, I even put together a drone from parts once. The last order was 4 sets of computer components. Only 2 have made it to the city, and those are stuck somewhere in the Customs area. Now, as you can perceive, they would really come in handy. Try to search the seized goods warehouse at Customs, they could have made it through the confusion there."
