"So, I called you out for this. I've caught a mole in my team, this prick was leaking info on my supply channels and points of interest. And I've been wondering on wtf is going on. My men got intel out of him and it turns out to be one of the local crews, those that settled by the dorms at customs.\n\nThe thing is, I want to give them some bullshit info on my \"next cargo\". And my men will cut them down when those pricks come for it. But this intel should be delivered with no fuss no muss, as if you were one of them, get it? You will need to stash the Flash drive with special info, my fellas left it in a red burned car, on the nearby bridge. They shit their pants to get closer. Stash that flash drive along with SV-98 and Rolers, just as agreed. And do not touch Scavs, when it's done - you just leave in silence.\n"
