"Well, fighter, and now it's time to start cleaning Tarkov from all this trash. You and I have come a long way and you still have a lot to learn. Well then, let's start with the area of ​​the chemical plant? A lot of useful things were being produced there, I had been working there for half a year as the security chief until the TerraGroup arrived. Since then, weird shit started happening there, I'm telling you, they gave up on producing cleaners and went on for something different, something dark. And as the lawlessness began, so they left, and the marauders began to disassemble the factory, and I remember every nook and cranny there. Long story short, it’s wrong. So go teach the bandits a lesson. If something useful still remained there, it would definitely be in the office area, you won’t miss it. Make the looters forget the way there, at least for a while."
