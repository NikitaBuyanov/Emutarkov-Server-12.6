"Hi! Do you remember the guy who had some business with Reshala? The one we gave the goodies last time. So, looks like he's got a taste of luxury lifestyle now, he wants some antique vases and antique teapots, I understand it with the vases, but why the hell could he possibly need so many antique teapots? Anyway, a deal is a deal, he pays well for it."
