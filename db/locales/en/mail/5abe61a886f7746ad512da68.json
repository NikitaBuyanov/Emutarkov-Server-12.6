"You know, I wonder why are you working with such a scumbag as the Skier! Even though of closing my doors for you, young man. But I see that you want to set this unpleasant situation straight. Good... I have a task for you - do it and weâ€™ll put the past behind us. Although people will hardly forget - God only knows whose hands got these chemicals now.Basically, my colleagues are going to search all the more or less significant objects in the district, looking for supplies for the suffering people. However, they failed to gain access to some places. Find particular keys and hand them over to me, thus helping our operation. To hell with the Skier, let's help people."
