"From previous experience I can see you’re quite a shot. Told Sniper about you, he wants to test your reaction time. The faster one wins. As in that film, remember \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", only with Mosin, ha-ha. Life here certainly isn’t a movie, but the reaction and the choice of position are very important to the firefight, especially in urban conditions. If you survive this, help yourself to the cowboy hat, I have one around here somewhere."
