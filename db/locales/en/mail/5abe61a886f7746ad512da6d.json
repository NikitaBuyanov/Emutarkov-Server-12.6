"Hey there! I don't know... I want out from these Masters deals. The PMCs are getting closer up their ass. Surprisingly, they don’t want to shut it down, but take over instead!Always thought of them as our guys, but somehow that is... unsound. But in times like these everybody goes a little bonkers, everybody feels the end is nigh. Briefly, that’s my last deal with them, won’t be doing anything for them anymore. Basically, they want PMCs to be heavily reduced throughout the area. And quickly. They’ll drop in some misinformation to kick off the action. No word on who’s trying to be the smartass, so you’ll just have to drop them without much distinction. The job should be done with SVD so the interested people would see who did the job... I don’t like it at all. However, the bounty is veeery tempting. So, it’s up to you."
