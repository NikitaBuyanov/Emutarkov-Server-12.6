"Did you find it? No way! Give it to me! Wait! Here, take this. A few days ago I've picked up a badly wounded USEC in the forest. I've tried to help him, but the poor bastard didn't make it. I've found this key in his bag. It looks like it is from one of their group stashes somewhere in the Health resort area. I think it might be useful for you."
