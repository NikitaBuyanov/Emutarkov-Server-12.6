"I have a delicate business to offer you. A gang of Scavs is operating at the Interchange, and let me tell you, they are quite an evil bunch. I suppose the world without them will become a safer place. But there is one condition - you must be wearing a chemical respirator and a 3M armor (Respirator and a Module 3M armor). Think of it as a certain element of education. Perhaps these useless folks can still return to the decent ways. In any case, they should understand who is decimating their people, so the distance must be short."
