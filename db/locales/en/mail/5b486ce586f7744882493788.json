"Time is running out, some guy stopped by who wants to sort it out with the Dealmaker, who is operating somewhere around dorms together with folks from the factory. Assemble him some MPX, with Skeletonized AR-15 pistol grip, Annihilator flash hider, and Steiner LAS/TAC 2 tactical flashlight. Aim for a sighting range of 300 or more, ergonomics above 61, weight less than4 kg, the less than 250 recoil sum. Just don't tell anyone about why do you need this, the Dealmaker wonâ€™t be too happy to hear about it, and his guys are quite a mean bunch, all served their duty before working at the factory."
