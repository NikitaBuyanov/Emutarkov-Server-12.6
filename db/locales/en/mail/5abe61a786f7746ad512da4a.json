"Hey there, fighter. Still fighting? Good. There is this job, a trifle, really. Obviously not your caliber, so not a business, but a favor, so to say. There’s a package for me, they stashed it in the bunker behind the sawmill. 60-rounds for a fiver. You know, popular product. So, there they’ve put a lock-up on the grill toward out drifters. Terra Group people used to hang around there in their time, and one of their brass has a copy of the key stored somewhere. He lived somewhere in the dorm by the Factory. So go on and check around. 50% goes to you on return. In fact, if you don’t manage it into the bunker, then find them elsewhere - I’ve got a pressing order."
