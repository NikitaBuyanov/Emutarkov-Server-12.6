"Good day, today I had the joy of understanding that we have a solid operation running, and it was not without your help. Blue Helmets now have a tight ongoing partnership with locals in all areas of business, and profits keep flowing in. Anyway, Business comes first, as they say. You have already been by the caved tunnel on the Shoreline. Terragroup attempted to move some cargo through it, but failed -- and now it is temporarily in the storage position, whereabouts unknown. Provisional headquarters for coordinating the company’s activities were moved to the resort when the conflict started, but, obviously, they are long gone as well. However, I think it’s safe to assume that they couldn’t move out everything, and we can try to get some information there. Computer coordination center was based somewhere on the third floor of the resort building."
