"And it's you? Glad to see you. Ever hunted prey on a hunt? When all this fuss started here in Tarkov, it all happened, and brother fought one another - it’s the usual thing, same works for the authorities, those who had to protect the law before, became unprincipled even worse creatures, some didn’t even change their uniform, can you imagine? I have personal accounts with them. Well, if you send some Scavs to hell, it will not be for worse, there has been nothing human left in these for a long time."
