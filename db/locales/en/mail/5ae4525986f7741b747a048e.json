"A certain character dropped by recently goes by the name of Mechanic. Tight-lipped type keeps silent all the time, must have heard about him. He bought nothing but said that he would be interested in fuel. And I remember that there were tanks at Ultra, on tow trucks with the German flag. To cut the long story short, go and mark them with beacons, and Iâ€™ll send some fuel to Mechanic, he promised to pay well."
