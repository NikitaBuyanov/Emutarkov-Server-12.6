"Good day! As you can understand, the conflict here was rather, serious and there is some heavy armor left on the Shoreline. There are at least three T-90 of which I am aware, and I am sure there are manymilitary devices remaining on them, such as laser rangefinders for example. Those models are not for export, and equipped with optics for domestic use. My customers would be very interested in comparing it to the samples owned by them. Mark tanks with beacons, and my people will do the rest."
