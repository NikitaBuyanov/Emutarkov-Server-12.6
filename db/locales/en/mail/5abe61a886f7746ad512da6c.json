"Masters - as my friends started calling themselves - are moving on. Now they need the stuff for developing this whole gladiator thing further.Honestly, I’m not too hot for all these moves - I don't like how this keeps spreading chaos. So come on - find everything they need yourself, and just hand over to me, I’ll pass it on on your behalf. Well, here's another thing, as proof that you didn't just get it for no reason, the Masters ask you to bring some noise to Tarkov outskirts. Not just like that, but dressed in a PACA vest and 6B47 helmet. I do not understand what a masquerade it is ... but these people are shady and they are interested in this specific appearance for some reasons.\n"
