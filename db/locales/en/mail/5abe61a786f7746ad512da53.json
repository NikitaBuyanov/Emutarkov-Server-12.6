"I want to ask you of service. Don't put up that look, of course not for free! In a small dorm, yes, the one inhabited by those bandits, somewhere on the first floor used to live a young paramedic from the factory. Unfortunately, I do not know the room number - when my colleagues and I were his guests on the Medical Worker Day, it was already dark, and in the middle of a party, you see. Well, he was a young specialist, still an intern, but very enthusiastic. Planned to enroll in the Military Medical in St. Petersburg. And in his safe, right there in the room, he kept a case with the particular new medical device. Issued to him by the employer. He tried to get out of town on his blue VAZ 2109 with St. Petersburg plates. I don't know if he managed it or not, but as far as I have heard, he either got stuck near the gas station or apprehended by the military. In any case, I could really put that tool to good use. Come the dark hour, and you might need it as well. Not that I wish that to happen, donâ€™t get me wrong, but... I assume you understand everything better than me. Look for it. Yes, I almost forgot, we have common interests with Arshavir in this matter. He has a good product for you. After successfully completing the task, of course."
