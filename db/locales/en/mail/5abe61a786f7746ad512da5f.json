"Got tired of waiting already. Documents that you got from the den of this humanoid weigh quite a bit. Pretty heavy they are. But this is damn dangerous cargo. And there is no clarity, who will be the best buyer for it. And it's not even so much about the profit, as it is about getting some enormous freaking problems if we choose the wrong addressee. So here the key that you found there as well, and try to dig up further.My guys said it's from a dorm room. And judging from the documents, our deputy chief was seen on the second floor of the first building. Any info you could find in this room can come in very handy, and the prize will be impressive."
