"Okay, here’s the next deal.Russia has kindly provided the UNTAR mission with several Tigr LAVs. Now the mission has virtually collapsed, and the vehicles are left to rot in the rain. I need you to locate three abandoned armored vehicles at Customs and mark them with beacons.There are still many valuables left inside that can be salvaged and sold, for example, to American intelligence. Unfortunately, I don’t have the beacons now."
