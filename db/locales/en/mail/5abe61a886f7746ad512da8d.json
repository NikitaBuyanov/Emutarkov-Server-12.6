"Hello,\n\nWe know each other long enough, and there is no possible use for any disagreements now. I'm sure you're interested in our partnership as much as I am. Don't worry, I won't push your trust. I've come into contact with a person who has a large stock of Western medical supplies, and he's willing to sell it to me, but for foreign cash only. If you can help me out with it, let's call it friends again."
