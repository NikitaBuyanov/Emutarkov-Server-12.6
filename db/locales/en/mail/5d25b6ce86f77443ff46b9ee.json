"Hello there! You came right in time, I'm just packing up to go hunting. Do me a favor, not for service, but as a sign of friendship. On my way back, I will need you to arrange a couple of points for a halt. The place should be safe, leave there a Russian MRE and a bottle of water, agreed? At the same time, whip yourself on your mustache on how to survive if you get caught with your pants down."
