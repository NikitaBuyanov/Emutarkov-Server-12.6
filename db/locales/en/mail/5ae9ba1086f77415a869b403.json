"Oh, brother, I’d be neck-deep in work without you. I'm doing it all for life, mind, to keep it real, so the city keeps on living, that’s why I do all the moves. Now I’m thinking of setting up garment manufacture, to sew and sell vests, holsters, armor. As in the best fashion houses in Europe, haha. Now I need to understand what is inside 6B43, how does it break down, and what it’s based on. Just like last time, bring me a couple of those, one totaled, and one a bit more whole."
