"Good afternoon, young man. Need help with a good cause. As you have long guessed, I collect food, medicine, and other necessities in order to evacuate the people. I don't want to deceive you, this is true. And now they have enough reserves for the road. And most importantly, through my channels, Iâ€™ve managed to negotiate on the other side for these people to be met let through. Can you imagine? But only the civilian population, no men under 60. Therefore, the first wave will mostly be children with mothers and a few elderly people. Almost everything is ready, except for one little detail - we need transportation. We have several vehicles, just enough to carry everyone from the first wave, but they are not running. They have been idle for too long, as I was told, and need batteries and spark plugs. Even fuel is not necessary. Four batteries and 8 plugs. Can you get that?"
