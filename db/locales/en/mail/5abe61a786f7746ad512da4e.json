"Hello, mercenary. Are you interested in a job, by any chance? Very well. Work is not hard for a gritty man like you, and won’t end up in losing. I can always provide food and drinks, and, most importantly - skilled medical care, in cases of almost any complexity. And for my loyal clients, who do not mind helping me with my business, I offer preferential terms for goods and services. But it's up to you for the future. If you prove that you’re reliable. In the meantime, here's a simple task - I need to obtain 5 emergency medical care kits. Go around as Salewa, the red ones. Know these? That’s what I need. "
