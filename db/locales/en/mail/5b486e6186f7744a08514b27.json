"Hey. My business is quite dangerous, it is good that you can safely come to visit me. But not all my clients can afford such luxury, one was already found in a pool of blood at the gas station. It appears that many are being watched, motherfuckers know they have thick wads. So clients don't want to drop by in the open, attracting more undesired attention. But that should not hinder the business, right? If people do not come for goods, goods go to people. Get the order prerequisites and hide the drop for proper folks at the Interchange. You need to drop 2 helmets and 2 headsets, plant them somewhere in Avokado. as for the 2 most exquisite Gzhel, bury them in the garbage heap, near the stage, also at Interchange."
