"Quite long ago, I once met the owner of Kiba Arms, we even went to banya then, though I’m not particularly into it. He, however, even broke his leg trying to jump-dive from the pier. Jolly fellow dreamt of setting up an Airsoft grounds all the time. It seems his wish came true in Tarkov, the largest and best-fighting grounds in the world, with an only minor difference: here, you die and lose everything from a single stray bullet. Put together an AK-102, with Rotor 43 silencer, Magpul AFG OD tactical grip, and Zenit 2U flashlight. Ergonomics should be over 53, recoil sum less than580, sighting range 500 or more. Make sure it doesn’t take up more than 8 cells."
