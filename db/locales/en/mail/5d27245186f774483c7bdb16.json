"For many years working as a gamekeeper, I know that if there is an infection in the forest, then you need to get rid of it immediately while the whole forest has not got infected. One such infection settled here, they call it Shturman, he and his crew set up at a sawmill, so now it has become dangerous in my native reserve. Deal with it, it will be for the better for the forest and for people."
