"OK, next job. NATO has carefully studied the conflict even before the blue helmets force surge and sent several drones to recon. But local air defence was apparently against democratic eyes. Two drones were shot down over the coast, now that getting to them has become possible, we can try to pull out the memory block from these. They should contain information about all movement at the beginning of the conflict. This information can make a good deal with my partners. Find their impact locations and bring me the memory."
