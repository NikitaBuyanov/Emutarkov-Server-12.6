"I know, smoking’s going to kill me. Who cares, though. I need to lay the wiring today, and plan for high power capacity, especially considering the continuous load on the grid. But that’s not the issue now, bring me some cigarettes. I want to work it hard until it’s done, and don't want to get distracted, so get me some 20 packs, better different ones. It’s been a pleasure."
