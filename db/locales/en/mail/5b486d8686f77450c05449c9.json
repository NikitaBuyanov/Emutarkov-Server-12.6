"How much does human life cost, how do you think? Not much, I guess. But what’s even more surprising for me, it’s the contemporary art market. The value of pieces by renowned authors grows every year. They are definitely talented, but the more you look at it, the more it seems that anything can be art. It can be a Grotko painting, a displaced urinal or a bunch of garbage. However, in my opinion, the most amazing pieces of art are weapons, starting with the melee - which is already universally recognized as such and can be found in many museums - to an old AK or M4, which are beautiful as they are. But weapon only then transcends to true art when it becomes unique, one-of-a-kind, in the hands of someone who knows how to use it, who modifies it for his own needs, creating a masterpiece worthy of being displayed in the best of museums. Bring me one such masterpiece, an M4A1 with NT4 FDE silencer, rifle length MK 10 handguard, a thermal scope, and a 60-round magazine. Ergonomics should be not less than 67, the recoil sum less than 280 and weighing 5 kg or less."
