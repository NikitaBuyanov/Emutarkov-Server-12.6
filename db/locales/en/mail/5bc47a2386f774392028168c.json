"My friend - Tadeusz knows him too - Shabelskiy was his name, he used to write stories about the war. Even I had fun time reading sometimes. So recently he sold the rights to the entire series of books, and they made a movie after them in the West. But now he wants more money from the movie company, apparently, hit the hard times. Even messaged me to look up some decent fighters here in Tarkov. It seems the whole world has forgotten about our city... They only remember us when they need a hired gun, and while things are going good they prefer not to notice our situation. Are you ready for the second test from Sniper?\n"
