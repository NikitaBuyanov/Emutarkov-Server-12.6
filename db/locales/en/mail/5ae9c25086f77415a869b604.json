"Hey. I’ll tell you, as a friend, that in trade it matters how you present yourself, not being a dork or a nerd. Then, not only girls, but also customers love you. This is my secret, feel free to use. I have a little business to Elvira, the chief therapist at the hospital. But I can only trust you with it if you up your charisma, she won’t even look at you now, no offense."
