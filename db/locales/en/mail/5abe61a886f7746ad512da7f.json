"Drives contained even more data than I expected. The cargo is in the resort, but the most important thing is that it got there after evacuation attempt. Since the West tunnel was destroyed, Terragroup folks, covered by USEC, tried to take it back to the port, but it was already roadblocked with the T-90. Hence, they scurried to stow it away, like prudent capitalists, ha-ha. We got to know that the cargo consisted of two parts, the first one, which included blue barrels, is located somewhere in the East Wing, the whereabouts of the second is unknown. Find that cargo."
