"Here is a note for the doc lady. Nothing much in there, just a couple of lines on our business. But here's the pain in the ass: if she knows that the note is from me, she’ll tear it up in no time. Try to gain her favor first, earn some trust, and then pass the note over. And don’t lose it, I’m not writing another one."
