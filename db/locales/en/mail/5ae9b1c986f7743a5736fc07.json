"Well hi there, brother, I’ve got an idea. Just imagine how fucking awesome it would be to have info on Ultra’s stocks. What was shipped, where, and what amount? I used to work with records like these myself. Fat chance there were any at small shops and outlets, they may have been run by slackers, but larger stores and retails chains definitely kept their records. Check out Goshan and other supermarkets, it would be mighty cool if you found some."
