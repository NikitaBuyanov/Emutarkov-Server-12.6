"Hello. As you know, there were different objects, secret and not-so-secret, within Tarkov boundaries. Many of them were hidden, and many of them have already been breached by scavengers. My customers are very unhappy about it. It is in their best interest that technology does not fall into the hands of... undesired persons. Therefore, we need to take them outside of the exclusion zone. There can be no mistakes, I need original materials only, so don't trust any resellers or third parties. Of course, those people are serious and will pay serious cash. I'll give you a list of what you need to find."
