"This one is for Sniper, it seems that heâ€™s about to set out to the woods somewhere to hunt down the villains for a week. Judging from the fact that he packed one hell of a backpack with MRE, flintstone, batteries, and water. Left it at my place for now. He needs an M1A, fitted with Ultimak M8 mount, Nightforce 7-35-56 scope, T1 reflex sight, HOLOsun tactical device. Ergonomics above 26, recoil sum below 350 and a total weight of 7.3 kg or less."
