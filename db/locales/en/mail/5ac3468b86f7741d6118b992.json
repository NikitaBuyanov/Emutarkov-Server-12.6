"Yesterday, someone was banging at the closed door in the kitchen. Sounds weird, right? I absolutely understand that this is impossible, but there was a sort of irrational fear inside. Like a child, when you're afraid of monsters under the bed. I think such fears grow stronger the farther away you are from civilization. When you're among others, as part of the society, even if you find a monster under the bed, you can tell someone about it. And when you're alone in the dark every day, it doesn’t work that way. I’ll tell you what it was next time since the irregularities didn’t end with it. For example, someone’s jamming my signal, presumably from the Shoreline territory. It’s a hard trick to pull without powerful antennas. Try to look for satellite dishes, most likely they use something that looks similar. There should be at least two, about 400-450 meters away from each other."
