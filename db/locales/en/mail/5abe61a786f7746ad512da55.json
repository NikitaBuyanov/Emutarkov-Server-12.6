"A little bird told me that you want to find some folder and pass to on to the medic. You do realize that we have a business here, and I have my own interest in disrupting her operations. A kind of sabotage, eh? Come on, bring this folder to me, and I’ll treat you right, send some proper cash your way, and there will be more trust for you. The hell I need it for? Don’t play dumb, take a guess. I’m opening branches here, building up the operation, and quality chow from those who’ve been preparing for all this crap in advance will sell like hotcakes through my channels. But I’m rambling, come on, on your way, I'll be here packing your cash."
