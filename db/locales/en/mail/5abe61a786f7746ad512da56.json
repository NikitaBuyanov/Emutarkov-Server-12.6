"Hello again. I have a temporary shortage with lasting foods in the form of canned meat. Can you help? I need a reserve 15 cans of beef. And I know I a couple of places where we can get them. Of course, our Scav friends. They used to have a storeroom at the gas station near the Factory - maybe there's still something left. Another food storage was somewhere in the dormitories, with more than canned goods there. But now I’m only interested in them, so you’re free to take the rest for yourself. Deal? I know that these two gangs are allied, but to prevent theft from the warehouses by their own people, their leaders have exchanged keys from each other's warehouses. So it should be pretty easy for you, I think."
