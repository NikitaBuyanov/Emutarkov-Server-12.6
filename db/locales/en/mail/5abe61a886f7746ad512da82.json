"How nice of you to be here, Sherlock. Those very cameras that weâ€™ve installed on the weather station, filmed a lot of interesting things. For instance, among other things, they spotted a group of Scavs, who looked like sailors or fishermen, dressed in tatters and waders mostly. Lately, however, they have stopped appearing. I take an interest in their activities as their turnaround seems rather impressive. Search the Shoreline for a place where they could possibly live and mark it with a beacon for my people."
