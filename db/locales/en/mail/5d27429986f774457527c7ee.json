"Here's the deal, as you can see yourself - I live in a wilderness, and sometimes I find badly wounded people, and I just have no means to help them. Some folks passed away right on my hands. I don't want that to happen again. Perhaps, if I have had a defibrillator or a surgery kit I could've saved them. Bring me a few of both."
