"Here’s the thing. This whole chemical deal worked like a charm, and it immediately became clear who do we push it to. And the receiving party is ready. Only one issue left to resolve. Find more of these yellow chemicals. The crux of the issue was partly resolved before us -someone has already tried. Don't know, consciously or not, but if you believe the consignment notes from the same docs, the whole box of that stuff was already tried to be taken out from the factory. But this cargo was not logged on any of the checkpoints, so I figure it’s worth looking for somewhere in the factory. And not just one lousy syringe, but a crate. Look out for some markings maybe, the box should have them. Seen? Ah, One more thing. My sweet, sweet friends Prapor and Therapist popped up, poking around. So come on, don’t turn coat. Just a bit more and we’ll be running this place. Good luck, bruh. I'll tell about you to Ragman - he'll get for you to buy some helmets. Really good ones!"
