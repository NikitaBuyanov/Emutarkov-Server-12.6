"Stay well, fighter. Still, in our fallen world, I see? But enough of that. There is one thing. So to say, rather sensitive. We kind of reached trust with you? So I’ll be trusting you now. I won’t go into details of why who and for what, not really related to the task at hand. And the task is to procure a package and move it to another place. Doesn’t sound hard, but there is a nuance. The pickup is at the Customs, and drop-off in the Factory. Interested?"
