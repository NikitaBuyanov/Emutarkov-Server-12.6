"I’ve said too much last time. It happens when I’m alone with my thoughts for a while. A lot of stuff slips through the head while I sit here calibrating the sights. That M4 turned out splendid, got taken off my hands in a moment. A bear dropped by recently, goes by the name of Sniper or something. He needs a sniper rifle Lobaev Saboteur, with a scope and multi-laser device. With recoil sum less than 400, ergonomics above 34, and weight below 6.6 kg. He said it needs to be a 2000m shot. The guy is serious, so do your best to make a solid build."
