"Oh, brother, come in. Do you want to get something cool? I have an update for you, but it's rare and not cheap. Bring me these things, and don't let them be worn out, my supplies are completely out, and I'm overwhelmed with orders. Try to find it in Ultra, they used to sell such materials there back in the day, but the looters probably took it all over Tarkov."
