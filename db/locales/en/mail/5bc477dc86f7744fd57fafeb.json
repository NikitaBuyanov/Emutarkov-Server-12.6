"Here you are. It appears that only you and Sniper can survive that long in the field, raid after raid. He was recently looking for a reliable guy, who can be entrusted with a task and be sure that he won't let you down. He says the best way to test a person in action is not with M1A with 20 rounds in the mag, but how well he can shoot a Mosin, through ironsights, at least 50 meters away. If this test is passed, then there’s sense in further talking. He is a serious guy who won’t ask for no reason, so it’s most likely he needs a man for some serious business. How do you think, can I recommend you? Try yourself in as the Tarkov Shooter, if you pass the test, I’ll arrange your contact with Sniper."
