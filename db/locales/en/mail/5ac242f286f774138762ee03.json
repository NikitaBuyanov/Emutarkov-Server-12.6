"Yes, I am the Mechanic. I have a lot of work to do. Get to the point, did you want to help? It’s a shame there’s so little time and the programmer unit for PLC100 is out of order. And those orders to boot. Whatever, why am I even telling you this? I need you to assemble an MP-133, I won’t have time for it, and some parts are missing too. This gun should have more than 55 ergonomics, a laser designator, an extended mag, and less than 950 recoil sum. And compact, too, not more than 4 cells. Then we'll talk."
