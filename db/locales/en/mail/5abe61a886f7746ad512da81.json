"Hello, my friend, glad to see you. It’s great you're still alive, ha-ha. As you can see, I and my people feel most comfy on Shoreline, and we also communicate with our partners and customers from here. We’ve managed to re-purpose the local meteorological equipment to transmit signals. Scavs, however -- or maybe not them -- always try to destroy or damage our antennas. We routinely deal with communication problems, even had to install surveillance cameras. However, it’s common knowledge that vandalizing gangs only understand violence. Your task today is what you do best. Explain to them that the weather station and the entire Shoreline is not the best place to damage the Blue Helmets property."
