"Well, since we’re now best pals forever, I think it makes sense to let you in on real business that real folks are running. That last order about the gear was from a certain dude. Peacekeeper is the name - I think you know who it is. Man himself is from UN force, which is here to prevent violence, supposedly. Can’t help laughing, ahahaha! I roll with him from the very beginning of all this fuck-up here. Working here, peddling stuff, stirring shit up and occasionally producing a body or two. To the point, he’s snowed with business and needs atough reliable guy, just like you. Obviously, I have my cut. And, as it is easy for you to guess, the opportunity to work directly with imported kingpin is not free. Yeah, yeah, off with that sour snot. Roll 6k bucks my way, and you’ll be doing business with all the benefits of Western civilization."
