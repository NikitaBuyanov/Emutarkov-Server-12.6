"While strolling through Ultra, you may have noticed how many cash registers are there, in stores and boutiques. Salvaging them all is impossible, but at least the cash can be taken. Should be especially plentiful at Goshan, not to take any risks, grab the spoils and go, but they are all locked, damn it. So I have an offer for you about that: get me a key from the registers, and I’ll let you in on the cool schemes I’ve never shown to anybody. As a brother."
