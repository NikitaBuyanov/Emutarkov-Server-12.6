"On to business. You've done quite a lot of useful services. Keep it this way, and I think I could let you in on the greatest secrets. We have one delicate matter to tackle, which should yield considerable profits. You've probably seen the Cote d'Azur health resort, a beautiful facility, is it not? The matter involves some activities inside I canâ€™t say more yet. However, observation data reveals that there are way too many Scavs in that area, their groups showing acute interest to everything that can be looted. Our task to explain to them that health resort is closed for them - the democratic way - has failed and now it's time to make it the hard way for them. How do you like 12 gauge guns? You might think that this way of persuasion is cruel, but it is extremely effective. I know you are good at it."
