" Hello. Good that you are here. I have a job just for you since you are already familiar with it. Our engineers have successfully neutralized chemical leak from the factory, but the water is still not fully rectified. Although only remaining pollutants are specific to petroleum products. We assume that this is connected to the TPP fuel oil storage next to the factory. Know these? It’s hard to miss, there's a big stack. Technical rooms of fuel oil storage and furnace facility must be nominally equipped with the same radio- and gas analyzers you found in the factory, if, of course, they weren’t stolen yet. Locate and bring them in and we will solve the water problem in the region, at least for a while."
