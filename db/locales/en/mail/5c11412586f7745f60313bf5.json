"Salam to you. So there's a guy, he was selling me some stuff which he found near the lumber mill, so he told me that he has found some stashes, filled with fuel barrels, you see?\nWho made those stashes? PMC's or Scavs - remains unknown, maybe those barrels are empty, but it's worth checking out. I want you to mark those stashes for me. Mechanic throws some serious money for fuel these days, he needs this fuel to power up his mining farms.\n"
