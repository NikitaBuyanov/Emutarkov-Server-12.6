"Good day, my friend. While you were dealing with justice, you surely noticed the helicopter standing at the health resort pad. We need to hurry and pick up everything of value that is left in it. It’s now wide open and dangerous in there. Your task is to mark the helicopter with a beacon and, most importantly, find the safe way to access it with a vehicle, preferably through the woods. Mark it, I mean the way, with beacon as well. After that, it’s Blue Helmets’ job."
