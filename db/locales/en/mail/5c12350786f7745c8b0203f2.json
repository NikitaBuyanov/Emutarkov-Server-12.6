"That intel worked out just as planned! They wanted to ambush my couriers but got caught by surprise. He-he. But now, my men are having some serious troubles with those pricks. This gang has outfits of their own, their key-fighters wear ushankas, scav vests and use MP shotguns, what a bunch clowns, aren't they? So, what you should do, dress up like one of them (Scav vest, ushanka and have MP-series shotgun) and kill PMC's, I don't care about factions, it's important to get PMC's into this fight on our side. You get it?"
