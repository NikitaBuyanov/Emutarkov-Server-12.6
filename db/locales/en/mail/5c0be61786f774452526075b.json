"Good day, young man. As a doctor, I think that the Hippocratic oath must be respected even in such a difficult time. So, I’ve got an idea to open a clinic. Health care is always important and even more so in these circumstances. But where do I get the necessary equipment?I'll give you a list of what I need you to bring. And I don't need competition, so make sure you complete the job with no third parties involved. Of course, I’ll find a way to reward you for your work.\n"
