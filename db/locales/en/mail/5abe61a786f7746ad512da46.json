"How’s it going, warrior? Still in one piece? Good. Look, there's a problem. If you pull through, we could talk about trust. Interested? Look here then. I had a pal who drove the tank truck at the factory. Managed to take the family out, but returned to get the stuff and perished. He lived in a dorm, the bigger one. Can’t remember the room, I was there only once and wasted as hell to boot. There was a poster of some chick on the wall for sure, the rest is foggy. To cut the long story short, he had an old bronze pocket watch with a chain. Sort of a family heirloom. If it wasn’t snatched by anyone, then there are two options - either it’s hidden in his room somewhere, or in his car. I want to get it out for the kid, his old man was not exactly a dipshit, worth to be remembered."
