"What can you expect when stuff like that keeps happening, fucking shit! We completely forgot about the power supply, and our local generators are out of order. My people suffer power shortages and it is totally not okay, because time is money. Many have carried out their activities in the resort before us. Search for generators that are still functional, most likely they are in locked rooms on the second floor of both buildings, weâ€™ll need a bunch of them. Just inform me when the rooms are located."
