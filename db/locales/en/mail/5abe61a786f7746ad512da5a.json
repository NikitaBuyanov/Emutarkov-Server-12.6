"Ah, it's you again. Decided to hang tight onto me then. Bloody awesome. I need to stir up some movement in our region. All sorts of outsiders keep popping up meddling with business, shoot, loot valuables off my guys, whack them indiscriminately. That makes me kinda unhappy, so to say, does not fall in line with my business concept. Make sure you use pistols so they would see that they're dealing with pro. Well, go and rake them operators of yours, and Iâ€™ll pay the bounty for every head, and even something extra for a present on top. Times are hard, and you have to make a living here somehow - preferably a good one."
