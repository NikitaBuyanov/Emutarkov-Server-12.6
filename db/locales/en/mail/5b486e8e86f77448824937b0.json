"Oh, I’m glad to see you so. Let’s go straight to business, I have to fetch or deliver quite frequently, carrying everything as a mule is hardly an option anymore. All vehicles are dead after some kind of an EMP strike during the mess outbreak. Nothing will start no matter how hard you try, even if you take them apart and put back together, only cars that came from outside can still run. There are bound to be some minibusses at the parking lot at the Interchange, mark three of them with beacons. My repair folks will examine them in detail, maybe there is a chance of success if I procure some electronics from the outside. Just make it cool, not some pieces of trash."
