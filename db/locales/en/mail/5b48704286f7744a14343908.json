"Oh, whassup! Let me tell you something. I settled in around here nicely, but something just doesn’t feel right anyway. I mean, there’s no confidence about what tomorrow may bring! Forget it, I just caught some sads ... Anyhow, I’d like to stay well-informed about what is happening in the neighborhood to feel more at peace.\n \nI’ll give you a hint of some shady spot where I’d like to install some smart cams. I’m not good at this stuff, so may boys will explain the details. The cameras can be found at the Mechanic’s, he used to sell them. Obviously, not a word to him about our business."
