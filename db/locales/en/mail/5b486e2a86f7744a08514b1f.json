"Salam, recently, I was approached by the guy who’s some sort of Dealmaker’s acquaintance. Posh as fuck, in a suit, and with signet on his finger the size of a bottle cap. I’ve seen him at some gathering once, he used to drive a BMW.\n He says that war or no war, his crib got to be lit. Well, not exactly crib, more, like, hideout. Fetch me a bunch of jewelry, and I’ll hand it over to him for these purposes. And search out some Roler watch, it will go as on the house, but it’s best to be at good terms, with such people, believe me, brother.\n"
