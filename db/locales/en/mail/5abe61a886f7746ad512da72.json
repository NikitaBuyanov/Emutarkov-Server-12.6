"Stay in good health! I remember that’s how locals greeted me when Blue Helmets first arrived. My people are now engaged in a very important matter on the health resort premises. Your help would be very well-placed, as usual. We are missing some tools for this work. This is very serious business, so you must make sure that equipment is intact. Resellers are not trust-worthy. Knowing your deftness, I think it won’t be hard to get the required items."
