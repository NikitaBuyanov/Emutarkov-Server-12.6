"Look who we've got here! Hello there! I've heard some rumors that there's still a lot of food left in the old military base warehouses. They say, that bandits began roaming there for food after the army left. Give me a favor, find their trails and the very place where those warehouses are. And then I will make sure that bandits' next visit will be a hell of a show."
