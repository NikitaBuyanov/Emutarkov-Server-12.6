"Are you good at hiding? Not good enough, I guess, for Sniper not to find you. I kinda feel for the guy, what’s his name, Brendan I think. Interesting, all our heroes of the past that caused such admiration, where have they all gone?\nWhy everybody turned out to be so empty. Why now, with this chaos around, such folks as Sniper became heroes for us? Why we’ve been ignoring such war dogs, and now we’re looking for their friendship? What do you think? I have another order, for R11 RSASS. With a sighting range of 1500 or above. Weight 6.5 kg or less. Also needs a silencer, ergonomics more than 58 and recoil sum less than 420."
