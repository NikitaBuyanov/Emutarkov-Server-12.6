"Hey there, man. Well, my friends are clearly up to something. Last time you dropped some Scavs, they called me almost instantly, and, you know, it seemed like they had a bit of entertainment going on. Making bets, making cash. Long story short, they want you to decimate Scavs again, but this time using good old AKSU. I don't really want to know what kind of show must go on, but they offer some top cash, so, how about it?"
