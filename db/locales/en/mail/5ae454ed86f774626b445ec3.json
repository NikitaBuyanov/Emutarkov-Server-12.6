"Hi there drifter, I have a solid business proposal for you. Don't you worry, I’m not shitting you, the real deal. Can’t say what it is right now, but if it starts off good, I’ll be sure to tell you. I need a couple of large backpacks, blue \"Pilgrim\" ones, and a couple of mask hats, you know, with ninja-type slits."
