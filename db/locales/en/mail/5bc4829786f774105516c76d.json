"Here, I’ve set up everything that may be needed to survive not only this conflict but also whatever will come after it. I’ve noticed that many survivors do so as well, to some extent, and my guess is the crisis will only worsen. Especially with food, water, and fuel. Everybody wants a warm, dry shelter. I guess you’re in good luck to be noticed by Sniper then. He says this night we need to try you."
