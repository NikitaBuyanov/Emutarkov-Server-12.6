"Glad to see you once again. My people found out who was involved in all of these illegal operations with clean water. Thanks to your information, of course. Well, it’s a gang of Scavs operating in the Customs area. I’m really not comfortable with this kind of requests, but there are lives at stake, and these scoundrels go on with their dirty business. We need to properly scare them off, so let them die in suffering so they would feel what they've done and what are being punished for. Will you do it?"
