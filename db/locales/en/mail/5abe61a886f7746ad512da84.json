"It seems Artyom lived in the health resort after the break of conflict, maybe was connected to Terragroup... or maybe not. No precise info yet. The nature of their joint operation with the fisherman is also not completely clear, but, considering the level of meetings secrecy, I'm pretty sure it's some kind of military tech. We can find from the list of tenants, if it still remains intact, of course, where exactly Artyomâ€™s quarters were. Visit the resort management office, such documents could possibly survive."
