"Hey, your last Scav cutting was off the chain!\nPeople keep coming and asking what the heck is going on. Turns out that my friends somehow negotiated with the local authorities - what’s left of them anyways - to set up a kind of mercenary fights, like gladiators. Imagine that! We just keep falling back to the Middle Ages with all this shit! In short, for them you are, what’s it called... Tester, sort of. Whatever they are coming up with, they reevaluate and adjust according to your actions. Long story short, I don’t really understand shit, but they suggest to continue. This time you will have a way more serious enemy, they want you to decimate PMCs, but you should be kinda disguised as a Scav, wearing their vest and having your face covered with balaklava. And also, you are supposed to scare off the Scavs - using 12 gauge shotgun. Seems like they're planning to start WW3 none the less, that will intensify scav on scav violence for sure... Are you in?\n"
