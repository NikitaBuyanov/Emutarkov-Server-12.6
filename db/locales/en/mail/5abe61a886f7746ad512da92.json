"Thanks for your assistance with the vans. We were just in time, even these Scavs didn't have time to pull them apart. While researching the consequences of the tunnel collapse, we’ve run across a Terragroup executive Gelandewagen. It appears that part of the company’s top managers perished there while trying to evacuate. I’m aware that medical research was one of the top priorities for the company, and I'm almost sure, that had no time to evacuate its data and materials due to lack of time. Whatever they were doing, I think it can turn out to be very valuable, both for us and for medical science in general. It can earn us a ticket from Tarkov, even more than one. I’ve regularly met up with certain Terragroup employees to discuss health care issues, so I was pretty familiar with some of their works. One of my acquaintances, who, by the way, directly reported to that deceased Gelandewagen management, used to live in the health resort building. Let me look it up... here it is, room 306. Inspect it for anything that could possibly be left behind."
