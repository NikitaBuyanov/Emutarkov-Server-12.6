"Our partnership has been quite fruitful lately, it’s great -- and I want to trust you more. After all, reliable people are always valued high, we are the first to know this. It's time to let you in on the delicate operation I’m running at the resort. However, first I would like to receive from you a certain proof of loyalty - a batch of ears, haha, just kidding. About ears, that is. Otherwise, it’s no joke, if you want in on the operation, I’ll need you to prove your loyalty, not necessarily with blood."
