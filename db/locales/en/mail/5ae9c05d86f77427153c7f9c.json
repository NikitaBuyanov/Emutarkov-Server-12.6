"Best of the day! We already went so far together, you’re like a brother to me. Like family, see, don’t get me wrong. So, like brother, answer frankly, do you like to read? I devoured books back then, as a kid. Now I need a book, for business. A rare bitch, true, but you can fetch a devil from hell. Get me a read about designing clothes from special fabrics, all that military stuff has to be made with aramid fabric, which has its own tricks to it. There is a kind of reference book on them, in two volumes, if you can get it, that’d be capital."
