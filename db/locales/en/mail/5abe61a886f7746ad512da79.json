"Our team always works for the good of the people, or at least we try to make it look so. Blue helmets peacefully deliver relief supplies to our region, but sometimes, attacks happen on us as well. Thatâ€™s what happened to two Ural trucks that were carrying UN-marked crates. We wouldn't be upset if not for the delicacy of the cargo, this time crates contained a little help not only for the people but also for USEC company. You understand that we cannot allow casting a shadow on the United Nations reputation. Find and wear UN uniform (UN helmet, MF-UN body armor) and teach local scum a lesson. Also, locate the spot where trucks were attacked, mark them with beacons, and bring me several MRE ration packs so I could present them as evidence, just in case."
