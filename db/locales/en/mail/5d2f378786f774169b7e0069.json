"Well hello there, warrior! How are you? Doing good? Listen, I've got an unusual task to do, the Mechanic asked me to make one special thing for his home, and this \"thing\" is such a cunning one that advanced electronics is required. And there's no place in the city where these things could be found, damn it. But there are rumors that somewhere there is plenty of this equipment in the Terragroup laboratory. There may be the details I need. Itâ€™s too dangerous in the laboratory itself to send you there now, but you should get me access cards. Will you help? Yes, cards should be new, not the ones that you could buy from traders."
