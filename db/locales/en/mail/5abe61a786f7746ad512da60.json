"That envelope from the dorm contained some chemical formula. And a reaction process described on the flash drive. We found a guy here who’s good with the subject. So he said that they cooked up something at Polikhim, experimenting with some blue liquid shit, adding crap there. Well, I wasn’t into chemistry at school! All sorts of chemicals, valences, indecent bonds! Oh, damn! Hehe. But you see, I still remember some words. That was some teaching! But whatever. It is necessary to confirm the experiment described there. And then this matter will shine upon us with new colors. This blue shit is abundantly scattered in barrels throughout the region, still, nobody knows what it is. And nobody is too eager to figure that out either. But we will take our chance and find out. And make some profits with it. But this requires another stuff, It should be somewhere in the factory. There was a room filled with garbage - they had a laboratory there. Look for bright yellow sort of syringe, looks like a pen, like morphine syringe. Well, you get the idea."
