"Polikhim hobo? The former security deputy chief? Yes, I knew him. All this mess caused him some massive damage - took to drinking, degraded to a hobo. And he wasn’t a bad guy... Wait a sec, can’t he say for himself? Got whacked or something? Well, doesn't matter, apparently, once you ask, then there are some problems. Well, I knew where he lived, but here’s the deal - I need help scaring off the Scavs from the Customs. If you help me, I’ll tell you where this hobo lived."
