"When I was a child, people used to say that it is not a destination that matters, but a journey itself. But what if the destination is yourself, what do you know, how you use your reflexes and how many rounds you have in the magazine? This feels particularly true when you're supposed to survive, clinging to this world with your teeth. I need an MP5. With 50-round extended mag, silencer, tactical flashlight and sighting range of more than 200. Ergonomics above 62, recoil sum less than 150. Maximum weight of 3.8 kg. And decide for yourself what is more important to you, the journey or the destination."
