"Good adventurous day out! Intense skin, brother, who are you hailing from, nikes? Or military? Well, whatever, I don’t care. Don't think I'm against PMCs or even mercenaries, it’s just the situation we have on our hands, in our city, is total shit. So I get it, you want to do business with me? Well, first I have to figure out who you are, get used to you around, you know? Let’s start with some trading and see how it goes from there before we talk business."
