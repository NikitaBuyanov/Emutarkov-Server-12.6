"Yesterday, as I was installing a reflex sight onto M4, I spotted on the monitor some local, who seemed to be praying. He painted different signs on the wall and on the floor, then walked into the middle of a circle these symbols formed, and started placing weapons there. It didn’t look strange, it even made perfect sense to me. It’s natural for people to give their gods the most valuable thing they have, now it’s weapons. I've heard that it's some kind of cult, maybe you've already encountered them. I have enough power capacity now. Look for some more graphics cards and coolers. And thanks for the package, by the way."
