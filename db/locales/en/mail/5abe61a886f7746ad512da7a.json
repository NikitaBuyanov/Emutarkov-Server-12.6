"I’m having this strange feeling lately. You know, you’re not the only person I work with, other people provide me with some other services. One, particularly sharp, informant, has been out of touch for awhile. The last message from him was about strange glow in the area of the old village and voices he heard there. Apparently, he then decided to have a look at what is going on there and went missing. The settlement was abandoned long ago and mainly consists of wooden huts. Try to find the informant or at least investigate what you can."
