"There is this shady guy in Tarkov. Folks call him Skier, the person is really shady, I’m sure that he doesn’t disdain the crime, I would have to watch him. They say he's looking for the flash drives, but I don't know what's on them. Knowing this type I bet there's something rakish. I’d like to know it for sure. I don’t know what kind of flash drives is he looking for, just bring me a few pieces, and then we'll figure it out. The Mechanic will help us understand what is there."
