"Hi there, what's up? You know, sometimes you have to come in and shoot the shit out of someone, and you have to do it quietly and efficiently. For example, I prefer 12 gauge, and I got no clue why the hell BEARs along with USECs don't appreciate it, it's straight caliber, you know? You just gotta get as close as possible, and if you have silencer, man, you can drop people and the guy on other side of the wall wouldn't flinch. It hits silently and it hits hard. You gotta master this, while I will figure out what fish can we pull out of your \"talent\"."
