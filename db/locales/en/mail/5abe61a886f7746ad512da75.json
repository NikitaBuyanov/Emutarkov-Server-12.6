"Good afternoon. My name is Peacekeeper, and you were recommended by Skier, as a man who knows his value and the value of loyalty too. Let's not waste time and get on straight to business. I need to deliver a certain gear to certain people. I’ll give you all the stuff. I'll give you everything I need to be moved, and your job will be to leave it all in a certain place - on the Shoreline, next to one of the - what’s it called - breakwaters. There is a boat, and that is where the drop shall be made. Is the task clear?"
