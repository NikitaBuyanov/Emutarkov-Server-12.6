"Greetings! Here's the deal, I've ordered a bunch of western guns from the Mechanic. Guns are foreign, I way more keen on fatherland made guns, native is way closer to the soul of an old soldier. Well, there's this M1A with Hybrid 46 silencer and Trijicon REAP-IR thermal scope, and I need you to give it a hard ride in action. And there's no way you shoot some scavs and that's it, you will have to give it some real deal. I will give you one of these rifles, and watch it! Don't waste it for nothing, because they cost a fortune, but if you lose it - that's your problem. I want this setup tested out."
