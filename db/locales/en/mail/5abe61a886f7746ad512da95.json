"Blood is a good source of information. Not as good as proper project paperwork, but good enough. It’s been a while since I did last research. I remember it concerned assisting a resident virologist with his thesis. Feels like it was, and at the same time so long ago. Spreading of the Internet has made it much easier to exchange information even with colleagues from other countries. I miss this opportunity now to sift through the Scopus database, I am pretty sure that it has the answers to questions that blood sample research has left. Where could one possibly find access to network now, you ask? To address this issue, I was advised to contact the one going by the name of Mechanic. As it turned out, he has access to the Internet, and it’s even relatively fast. I’ve asked him to look up the necessary articles for me. He asked for a small fee for his services, but in the form of apropellant powder, for whatever reason. It looks like he’s dealing in supply of ammunition or something like that, I was not interested enough to pay attention. Most importantly, he will provide the info we need. Procure what he asks for, and leave it at the specified spot in the Factory. it’s swarming with Scavs in the daytime, so it’s best to do it at night."
