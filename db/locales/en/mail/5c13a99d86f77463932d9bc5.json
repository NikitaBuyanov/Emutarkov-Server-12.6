"I have recently stumbled upon some interesting devices... First one appears to be some foreign storage device and the second is apparently a reader of some sort. Extremely interesting pieces, I'm telling you. And most importantly, it’s the first time I’ve seen them. Maybe some kind of import broke through the blockade or a secret warehouse cracked open. Clearly not domestic production, so my money is on the latter. And hey, you'll need to find it yourself since it's high-quality equipment - you can't rely on resellers, they would fool you for sure. If you can bring it, I’ll make it worth your while."
