"As Dima likes to say, the best tool against a sniper is another sniper. It is not a rare case in combat, but you have to keep in mind that the enemy is well trained and well prepared shooter. He is smart, will take up tricky positions and try to deceive you. Even if he's not a professional military, and but former gamekeeper or so. You need to tie down the enemy sniper, make him work - then, heâ€™s all yours. Well, these are recommendations I was requested to convey to you, and now the task is to identify the snipers and put them down."
