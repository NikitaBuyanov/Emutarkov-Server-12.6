"Extreme events like this reveal the real personality and show who is who. Some people stay the same, some people don't. And recently I've heard the rumors about the new power in the area. The ones - who became fucking monsters. Folks call them - raiders. They come out of nowhere, rip places apart, take what they need and vanish as if they never were there. People say that they mostly are ex-military and rival PMCs. I've also heard that they have someone powerful behind them, and this person is pulling the strings from abroad. Find them and show them what their place in the foodchain realy is."
