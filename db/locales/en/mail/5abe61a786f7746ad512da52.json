"There is more work if you are interested. I think you have already understood, that I support the civilians remaining in shelters, who, unfortunately, didn't have the time to get out of the perimeter. In fact, all your fights are just a means of achieving the goal for me. And the goal is to help the innocent people to survive until the possible end of this nightmare. Or until evacuation. You strike me as a more-or-less normal person, not yet an utterly devolved monster like most of your peers who come to me. Therefore, I shall ask you. I need morphine. And not for sale to drug addicts. I am a doctor, after all, young man, and gave the oath. Many civilians are injured because of your constant firefights. Stray bullets, grenade fragments. And there are women, and the elderly, and children. And they are not combat-hardened thugs, they can not, and should not, endure such pain, biting on the rifle sling. I know that USEC used to carry supplies of single-use syringes in their SUVs. Get me at least 5 of those."
