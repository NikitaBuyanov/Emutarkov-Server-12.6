"Not a good time! Although... Hang on. There is an urgent matter. There was a firefight about an hour ago in the garages across the river. Just where my errand boy was headed. To hell with him, he was a total jerk anyway. But he had with him one particular key. A mighty complex key, I might add. To the door that can be freaking wherever see? This clown was delivering me one very valuable thing. Hid it somewhere, bastard locked it with this arsetormenting key and came to me to talk up the price. What a biatch! I sort of raised the fee a bit, for the thought, but this wanker still hasn’t told me where and went to get it himself. And I’m almost sure he’s got done in there. Find the key, and then find me the package even if you have to check all doors from the center to the port."
