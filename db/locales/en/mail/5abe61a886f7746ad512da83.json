"You hit the spot there, my friend. My partners are very interested in what this affair can bring us. Helmets inspected the place you marked and found out that some fisherman lived there for a while. It seems, though, he is long dead, and people on cameras are his friends. However, it is known that he was friendly with a certain person called Artyom, who was often seen driving yellow Daihyn. Their shared business was somehow linked to the Russian military, now you understand why it can be fun? Most likely, Artyom’s car remained on the Shoreline after the conflict, it’s a fat chance he managed to drive off with it. Use the provided description to find it, write down the plate number, and we’ll use it to get the details on who that Artyom may be."
