"Hey you, get over here, big deal is about! You probably heard already that there are a couple of foreign drones downed in the area? Good people have asked me to salvage something for them, controllers or whatnot. I don’t know what that is, I, frankly, I don’t give a fuck, all I know is that they’re paying some good crispy green and obviously don’t want our domestic tech pool expansion. These drones are most likely already pulled apart, but it’s still worth a look.\n \nKeep in mind, that before they lost contact with command, USECs received an order to check up the drones and fetch the gyros from the abandoned Russian vehicles. You need to search the places where they used to hang out. It’s fucked up to work for them capitalists, but such pile of cash is stronger than my patriotism."
