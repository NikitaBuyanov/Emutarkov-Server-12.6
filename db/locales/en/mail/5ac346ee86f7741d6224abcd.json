"I've been thinking about that thing we discussed last time. Have people really become more kind with the development of civilization? Do they really go hand in hand? All this time, where we believe there is civilization, life has become more comfortable, easier. There were increasingly fewer worries about security or getting something to eat. It's easy to be humane when nothing is threatening you. The answer to these questions was right before my eyes. The situation in Tarkov has shown us how much kinder we have become. Once the issues survival came to the front, it turned out that decent people aren’t more common than maybe 500 years ago. Probably even less. What do you think, are you one of them? Okay, don’t overthink it. I need you to do something for me. However, you will need to remember quite a lot for this job. Practice in memorizing large volumes of information, I’ll contact you later."
