"Glad to see you, young man. I have a well-paid job for you. Since you are already aware of the problems with drinking water in the region and the origin of these problems, I can entrust you with the following information. We found out what exactly is contaminating the aquifer and we know how to stop it. We need a few more days, but it will be done. Qualified engineers are already on it. But until then will have to survive on the remaining scarce reserves. Which are very scarce indeed. However, to my knowledge, some people managed to make hay and stock up on clean water prior to the pollution. This is the gang that inhabits the dorm area next to the factory. Several people saw them carrying large plastic barrels with water there. Canâ€™t blame them for trying to survive the way they can, but they do not need as much, they just do not know that in a few days everything will be solved. And due to the lack of water, many may not live up to this point. Please locate where they store their water supplies and tell me."
