"A USEC group used to be stationed in the resort, and after this mess broke out, they have left behind a lot of goods, especially in locked premises. My friends have decided that this is a great place for the production of some compounds... After all, isn't it a Blue Helmetsâ€™ job to make people's lives easier? However, I only help with necessary supplies, distribution is handled by other people. I'll introduce you to them when the time comes. I hope all you have learned will stay between us. Now go and bring me everything that my friends need."
