"What’s up, warrior? What’s your interest? Cash? Goods? The right place for both, but who are you and what are you made of? It’s the first time I see you and no offense, but I’ve lived too long to trust people right away, so you’ll have to prove how tough you are in the field. There’s no shortage of would-be tough guys in our fair town lately, you know. Then we’ll see, if you’re worth something, greeting might get warmer, prices lower, and stuff cooler. Fair enough, right? Okey-dokey then. Since you agree, for starters, waste, let’s say, five deadbeats around the Customs and bring me 2 MP-133 shotguns as proof."
