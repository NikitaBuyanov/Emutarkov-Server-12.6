"Hello my friend, how are you doing? Not exactly awesome, I know, thatâ€™s just how the times are now. My people have run across some really interesting rooms in the health resort, which are, unfortunately, locked tight. It is known that USEC folks were stationed there earlier, and we also learned that they stored the keys at the checkpoint, in a concrete bunker, North-West of the resort. Since they packed in a hurry, there is a chance you may find something there."
