"Good day. There is work for you. Before all this, customs and factory personnel lived in the dormitories on Customs, but now there are only looters, okay the scavs - these fools have their brains completely beaten off. But often the BEARs and the USECs go there, and this is not good at all, they just rob the place, I hate looters! Whatever times are, you must remain human in the first place."
