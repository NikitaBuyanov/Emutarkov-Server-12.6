"There you are, I was just waiting for you. Just a couple of hours ago, my old friend Jaeger got in touch with me and informed me that he had quite useful information for me. The packet with the information I need is encrypted and is located in the Priozersky protected area. Where exactly - the Jaeger did not specify, but left a clue “Look where the hunter would wait for his prey.” Bring me this bag. And you'll love the reward."
