"That last chemical deal damaged my trust in you. I’m not the type to hold on to grudges, but that trick you pulled was mean, I don’t like acts like that. If you want to straighten things up with me and regain trust - do one favor for me. The customer who expected these chemicals were left in a tight spot, and on top of that, I haven’t even delivered the grenades from the previous order yet. The grenades he needs are foreign-made, I don’t have anything like that. Get me some of these - and we’ll call it even as if nothing happened."
