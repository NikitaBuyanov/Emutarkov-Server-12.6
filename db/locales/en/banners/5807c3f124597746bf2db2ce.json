{
	"name": "Scavs",
	"description": "Amidst the chaos and lawlessness, scarcity of vital provisions and territories, the first to lift up their heads are shady characters, unembarrassed by excessive moral or ethical restraints or quick to lose them under influence of conditions. They gather into packs, living by dog-eat-dog rules,cutting each other throats over a better piece. This is how yesterday's civilians become Scavs."
